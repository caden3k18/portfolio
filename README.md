# portfolio
Derived from a really good React JS tutorial by EGATOR

I am kind of taking myself through a crash course on React JS. It's pretty awesome so far!

The site turned out pretty well, though I definately need to update the background and based on how it looks on my phone, I will probably have to tweak a few things. I am waiting for now to get some feedback from a few friends as to how it looks on their devices.

As it's a portfolio oriented site, I decided to just go ahead and post it!
